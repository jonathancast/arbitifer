# Concepts for Ticketing System

* Central source

* Information not in ticket system is linked to from tickets

* Milestones achieved for tickets, not ticket status

* Ticket types listed in a table

* Plugins can define a subclass for ticket types

* Ticket types can be subtyped as many times as you want

* Free software but plugins can extend the system
  without needing to modify the base code
